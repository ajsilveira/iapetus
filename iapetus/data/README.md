## Manifest

* `dppc-hydrogens.xml`: Contains definitions for the hydrogen atoms of the DPPC membrane. It should specify the type of each hydrogen atom (name) and the atom to which it is bonded (parent). This is required since hydrogen.xml, which is used by default in OpenMM, only contains information for the standard amino acids and nucleotides.
